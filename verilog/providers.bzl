    As VerilogInfo should be created via 'merge_verilog_info' (rather than directly),
    the new entries being passed in should be created with this function in order to
    ensure the struct contains the correct fields.

    Any fields marked 'legacy' are under immediate plans to be deprecated. New uses
    should be avoided. Fields marked as 'experimental' are more likely to experience
    changes in semantics in the future. Future users should exercise caution before
    using them and consider consulting the rule maintainers first.

    Args:
      srcs: A list of File that are 'srcs'.
      hdrs: A list of File that are 'hdrs'.
      data: A list of File that are `data`.
      deps: A list of Label that are deps of this entry.
      label: A Label to use as the name for this entry.
      tags: A list of str. (Ideally) just the entry tags for later filelist filtering.
      includes: A list of additional include directories. Similar to the parameter of the same name in `cc_library`.  The package path is prepended.
