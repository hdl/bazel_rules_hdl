        libname: Libaray name like 'h169l3p48'.
        include_vts: 'all' or list of vts ('rvt', 'lvt', 'slvt') to include in the output.
        include_corners: 'all' or list of corners ('ff', 'tt', 'ss') to include in the output.
        include_volts: 'all' or list of voltages (in '0p55v' form) to include in the output.
        include_temps: 'all' or list of temperatures (in 'm40c' or '125c' form) to include in the output.
        include_adders: 'all' or list of adder styles to include in the output.

    Returns:
        A list of tuples containing a unique name for the cell library
